      <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The ODZ pack was started in 2002 when Zeus came home with us as a puppy. He was very lonely, so we (*my wife*) decided to rescue another Italian Greyhound. Although we intended to adopt another puppy or young dog, Zeus chose Odie and cried when anyone tried to separate them. Odie was a street dog who was thought to be about 7 years old. We rounded out the pack when we brought Demeter home in 2004. Demi shared the same parents as Zeus, although from a later litter. The ODZ pack was famous in the Central Florida dog park community for their crazy antics and jumps. They've been our hiking companions from Key West, Florida to the Cascade trails in Washington. Even in their old age, they still enjoy an occasional run and yelling at other dogs who dare pass in front of the house.

      <h3>Odysseus King of Ithaca</h3>
      <p>Nicknames: Odie, Odie-bear, Oh-oh, Odie Wodie Pumpkin Pie</p>
      <p>Size: 15 inches tall, 14 lbs</p>
      <p>Themesongs: "Kiss You All Over" by Exile</p>
      <p>Hobbies: licking everying that held still, eating</p>
<p>Personality: Odie was the omega of the team, and truly a lover not a fighter. He loved wearing clothes, the fancier the better. He was the Liberace of Italian Greyhounds. Found on the streets, we were unsure of his exact age. At adoption, Odie was 21 pounds, which we soon discovered was due to his food-stealing ways. Dieting and Demi's constant harrassing him to play helped get him down to a healthy 14 pounds. Odie was the stability in the pack and acted as a "grandpa" to Demi. We had to say a sad goodbye to Odie in 2011 when he developed cancer. We were fortunate to have him for the last half of his life, and he loved everyone around him.

      <h3>Demeter Goddess of Harvest(Sister of Zeus)</h3>
      <p>Nicknames: Demi, Dems, the Bebe, Beebers</p>
      <p>Size: 16 inches tall, 13 lbs</p>
<p>Themesongs: "Naughty Girls Need Love Too" by Samantha Fox</p>
      <p>Hobbies: Running, jumping, harrassing everyone around her.</p>
<p>Personality: Demi never met a rule she didn't want to break. By far our most athletic dog, she's known for her jumps and for the amount of havoc she can create. She's always at the center of trouble, and frequently dragged her brothers into the mess with her. Her only saving grace is the radiant joy she exhibits while doing exactly what you told her not to do. She greatly enjoys pouncing the cat, but as she weighs less than him this sometimes backfires. Demi is a true breed snob and strongly disikes all other dogs if they are not Italian greyhounds. Even though Demi is a senior dog, we've given up hope that she'll ever settle down.

      <h3>Zeus King of the Gods(Sky and Thunder God)</h3>
      <p>Nicknames: Zooboo, Zeusy, Zuzu</p>
      <p>Size: 17 inches tall, 15 1/2 lbs</p>
      <p>Themesong: "Dancing with Myself" by Billy Idol</p>
      <p>Hobbies: humping other dogs, whisker nibbling, being handsome</p>
<p>Personality: Zeus took being named after the king of the gods a little too literally, and thinks he can boss around a Great Dane. He's a very thoughtful, intuitive dog. He intently watches for cues and tries to anticipate commands. He's one of the few Italian Greyhounds who love to swim, and he loves playing at the beach. He was inexhaustable as a puppy, but as time has gone by he's mellowed out. He thinks cats are pretty cool and is the only one of the dogs who will snuggle with the feline sibling. At 15 years old, Zeus is mostly deaf and sleeps most of the day, but he's still got a lot left in him.
